Aerosols significantly influence air quality, climate systems, and human health. Accurate and large-scale monitoring is essential to understand regional pollution patterns and support environmental decision-making. This project focuses on retrieving Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) from MODIS satellite images using an advanced Multi-Modal Vision Transformer (MViT) model, targeting five areas in Visakhapatnam over a 10-year period.

The model was built using a Multi-Modal Vision Transformer (MViT) to analyze spatial and temporal aerosol variations.

MODIS satellite data was collected from the NASA Earth Data platform for five regions including Dwarka Nagar and Gajuwaka.

The data was processed using Python tools like GDAL, Rasterio, and Google Earth Engine, then visualized using Plotly and Seaborn.

The system performed year-wise, month-wise, and area-wise AOD analysis to detect seasonal and regional pollution trends.

This solution enables interpretable and scalable air quality monitoring, assisting climate researchers and policy-makers.
